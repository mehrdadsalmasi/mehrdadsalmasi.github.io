I am a researcher in theoretical/computational neuroscience, with interests ranging from information flow in synaptic communication to probabilistic models of economic decision-making and the overarching realm of Bayesian brain. 

I got the privilege to work as a postdoctoral research fellow at the [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/), University College London, under the supervision of [Professor Maneesh Sahani](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/9384). Our research focused on neural representations of uncertainty, exploring how the brain learns to encode uncertainty and distributional beliefs, and how these representations can be utilized by the hippocampus for probabilistic localization, structural learning, and planning.

I undertook my subsequent research at the [Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research](https://www.mps-ucl-centre.mpg.de/) to work with [Professor Raymond Dolan](https://www.mps-ucl-centre.mpg.de/11822/dolan-ray) on probabilistic models of economic decision-making. We have developed a framework for the inference of preference/risk measures of the agents and proposed a biologically plausible model through which the dopaminergic system can compute these measures.

Prior to my appointment at University College London, I completed my PhD in theoretical neuroscience at [Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich](https://www.gsn.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) and the [Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience](https://www.bccn-munich.de/) under the supervision of [Professor Stefan Glasauer](https://www.b-tu.de/universitaet/die-btu/kommunikation-marketing/medienservice-presse/expertenvermittlung/alle-expertinnen/prof-dr-ing-stefan-glasauer). Together with our collaborators, we investigated the information efficacy of dynamic synapses under short-term depression/facilitation using information-theoretic methods. Before transitioning to the field of neuroscience, I studied electrical engineering at Isfahan University of Technology under the supervision of Professor Jamal Golestani, where we evaluated the capacity of erasure networks in the presence of spatial network coding.
